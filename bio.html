          <br>
          While I’ve had a lot of jobs in my career, one thing has always remained consistent - the involvement of technology. From being a Brewer to a Software Support Specialist, technology has always been integrated into my day to day responsibilities. With over 6 years in the IT Support industry, I was tired of supporting software that was consistently crashing, had bugs, or just didn’t work. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and join the Software Engineer Immersive Bootcamp at General Assembly.
          <br>
          <br>
          My goal is to create software that is consistent, effective, and has the client and user experience in mind.
          <br>

          A lifelong Georgia resident, I am a big fan of Atlanta sports (Atlanta United, Braves, and Falcons). Staying true to my Georgia roots, I also love to smoke meat on my offset smoker, which is paired best with my homebrewed beer. I enjoy visitng new breweries in the Atlanta area, adding a new movie to my collection, or hanging out with my wife and dog.
