# portfolioFINAL

Used primarily HTML, jquery, Javascript and CSS.

By day 4 came around, I probably had scrapped my idea/plan and clean slated things about 5 times. each time I did, I felt more confident with the language I was using. No doubt I faced some issues and confusion but made it easier to rewrite and know what I building the next time.
